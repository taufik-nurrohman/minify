Motivation
----------

This project was started as a [gist][gist/minify], which now has more stars than [the copy of it][mecha-cms/x.minify],
that was actually made to abandon the gist. It was inspired by [a code snippet][ideone] that will probably get lost in
the future, so I decided to make a copy of it and put it [here][gist/ideone].

I once got an e-mail from someone who wanted to use some parts of [my Mecha CMSâ€™ extension][mecha-cms/x.minify], for him
to use in a proprietary application, so he hoped not to be bound by [the GPL restrictions][article/gpl].

etc etc ...

Usage
-----

This converter can be installed using [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/taufik-nurrohman/minify), but it doesnâ€™t
need any other dependencies and just uses Composerâ€™s ability to automatically include files. Those of you who donâ€™t use
Composer should be able to include the `index.php` file directly into your application without any problems.

### Using Composer

From the command line interface, navigate to your project folder then run this command:

~~~ sh
composer require taufik-nurrohman/minify
~~~

Require the generated auto-loader file in your application:

~~~ php
<?php

use function x\minify\c_s_s as minify_css;
use function x\minify\h_t_m_l as minify_html;
use function x\minify\j_s as minify_js;
use function x\minify\j_s_o_n as minify_json;
use function x\minify\p_h_p as minify_php;
use function x\minify\x_m_l as minify_xml;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

echo minify_css('asdf { asdf: 0px; } asdf { /* asdf */ }'); // Returns `'asdf{asdf:0}'`
~~~

### Using File

Require the `index.php` file in your application:

~~~ php
<?php

use function x\minify\c_s_s as minify_css;
use function x\minify\h_t_m_l as minify_html;
use function x\minify\j_s as minify_js;
use function x\minify\j_s_o_n as minify_json;
use function x\minify\p_h_p as minify_php;
use function x\minify\x_m_l as minify_xml;

require 'index.php';

echo minify_css('asdf { asdf: 0px; } asdf { /* asdf */ }'); // Returns `'asdf{asdf:0}'`
~~~

Notes
-----

This project focuses only on removing white-spaces. Other improvisations were considered as a bonus, as they were safe
to modify the source code. It canâ€™t read your code and only perform generic tokenization, like grouping comments and
strings as a single token. It wonâ€™t fix your code, like adding an optional semi-colon at the end of a line because it
was followed by a line-break, so the semi-colon was optional initially, but then your code will be broken after the
minification because the required line-break is now gone:

~~~ js
// Before
a()
b()
c()

// After
a()b()c()
~~~

I still donâ€™t quite understand why this way of writing JavaScript has become so popular these days. Someone who started
[this standard][standard/standard] is probably into [Python][python], but he doesnâ€™t want to admit it.
